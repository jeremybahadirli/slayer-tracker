# Slayer Tracker

Compare XP and GP rates for each Slayer task given your actual performance. Determine which tasks to do, skip, and
block.

**Note:** By default, this plugin only counts time when the Player is engaged in combat. AFK time between kills is not tracked. Due
to this, experience and profitability rates will typically report higher than what is actually received. The advantage to this is:
values are consistent regardless of focus level, so tasks can be more accurately compared with each other.

This plugin should not be used to track *actual* experience or profitability rates; it is intended to be used as a
comparison tool to compare different Slayer tasks to each other.
