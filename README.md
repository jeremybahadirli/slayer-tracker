Compare XP and GP rates for each Slayer task given your actual performance. Determine which tasks to do, skip, and block.

**Note:** This plugin only counts time when the Player is engaged in combat. AFK time between kills is not tracked. Due to this, experience and profitability rates will typically report higher than what is actually received.

This plugin should not be used to track actual experience or profitability rates; rather, it is intended to be used as a comparison tool to compare different Slayer tasks to each other, by normalizing for varying focus levels of the Player.
